# Mission_to_Mars  
  
## Purpose of the project  
  
The goal of the project is to create a webpage to display data and images from the planet Mars.  
  
I used BeautifulSoup and Splitter to scrape the desired data from a series of specified websites.  
  
I used Flask to set up the web site.  
  
The code for the webpage (index.html) is formatted with bootstrap.  The bootstrap grid system insures that the webpage is responsive to different devices.  
  
The background color of the bootstrap Jumbotrom teature was changed and a background color was added to each of the web page elements.
